        <h1 id="On_the_inclination_of_developers_to_design_the_problem_to_fit_their_solution">On the inclination of developers to design the problem to fit their solution</h1><p>When in a discussion between developers on the best technical solution for a problem, they often ask eachother “Yeah, but What if…” or “What about when…”. </p>
<p>As a manager, or technical lead, be wary! This can lead to dangerously over-engineered solutions, or worse-yet, devising solutions to problems that are created by the development team which are, in fact, outside of the problem scope of the business.  It is important to know and understand the business problem intimately, and from that vantage, to pose the question, “Why…”, with respect to the proposed solutions.  Moreover, it must be asked from  the temporal perspective of a future maintainer of the code:  “Why… did they take this approach…”, “Why… did they use this technology”, “Why… is this so complex… or naïvely simple?” </p>
<p>Managers and tech leads must remember that technologies are trendy and ephemeral. The problems faced by larger software organizations do not typically apply to small or mid-sized businesses, yet developers at smaller companies trend to adopt solutions that are realized from far more complex problems. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" target="_blank" rel="external">KISS</a> principle, or Einstein’s quote, “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.”, resonate. The most value-driven, and therefore valuable, people, will try to reduce the solution’s complexity such that it is no greater than the complexity of the problem.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.businessblogshub.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rope.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Perhaps this is where some methodologies get things right: get it to work, then get it to work well, then get it to work fast.</p>
<p>The benefit to the team and company is reduced cost, code comprehensibility, and consequent maintainability. </p>
<p>This doesn’t address the fact that good developers <em>want</em>, or perhaps <em>need</em> to work with interesting technologies, or on interesting problems. This, I think, is where “scrum” and “agile”, is suffocating developers with a drive to innovate.</p>
